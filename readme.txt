Shortcodes for simple, minimal buttons. Includes options for hover animations, icons, analytics tracking, and click events.

== Description ==

SoulButtons was designed to give WordPress developers a simple, consistent, effective approach to using buttons (and other actionable links) in their layouts.

SoulButtons was conceived by a designer who found it difficult to maintain the balance between priority (e.g. how to make more important buttons/links stand out from others), consistency (limiting button styles and their behaviors so that site visitors understand how to find the right information/conversion paths), and ease of use (so non-CSSers and non-UXers could join the party) with respect to custom-coding button styles and behaviors.

SoulButtons also makes important (yet complex) button functions available just by assigning a shortcode attribute. Got Google Analytics installed? Add the track attribute and you'll see what buttons your users are clicking on more than others in your Analytics 'events' area. Need to show an element inside a dialog/modal window when a button is clicked? Assign target and targetEvent attributes to a SoulButton and you're all set.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a button? =

Use `[soulbutton]` shortcode or a button in WP Editor to generate it.

= How do I use the shortcode? =


The same way you use other WordPress shortcodes. Just wrap your button text with `[soulbutton]` and `[/soulbutton]` tags. You can use several different attributes to customize appearance and functionality of the button. See them in the next question.
Sample usage: `[soulbutton link="http://google.com"]Go to Google[/soulbutton]`

= What attributes does `[soulbutton]` shortcode have? =

Here is the list of available attributes:

* `style` - allows to choose button appearance. Available styles currently include `solid` (default), `rounded`, `border` and `transparent`.
* `link` - where button link should point to. Defaults to `#`.
